# Open Purchase Orders

**When**: 1st of the month

## methodology

Any time materials are ordered, there's a chance that something can go wrong:

- The digital record of the order being placed is incorrect.
- The items which were ordered do not arrive on time or at all.
- Items which did arrive were not recorded as having arrived.
- Orders were not paid for.
- Orders were paid for, but the act of payment was not recorded.

The Open Purchase Orders process attempts to catch these many eventualities. Consequently, any search for "open purchase orders" should capture each of the categories above.

In the Sierra cataloguing system, order records contain information pertaining to these categories.



## instructions

What is on the list ?
These are order records that were created more than 4 months from the date of the list.

What to do ?
take a screenshot of the list

If the RDATE field is blank, it means the orders were not received.
- Email these to Fred

If the STATUS field is not A (Fully Paid), then it means the invoice was not paid
- email these to David

Final step :
Go back into create lists and empty the list

Why ?
Until the next audit ? JMRL has to keep the payment record

Special Notes :
- check the first few items against the previous month’s list. (these are special, or something ? I forget why)
- look for a note field first 
- is the item suppressed ?
- In Thorndike, david may expense the invoice and not mark paid, or didn’t pay
- In Midwest, go to :
	Tools > Search Orders ,
	Or can search by item itself (use the thing that looks like a sash window)
- with the catalogue :
	A .bib record gets overlain with cataloguing
	- if there’s just a stub, need to confirm that the physical object is at central / jmrl
- B-T
	(1) publication delayed
	(2) go to BT confirm shipment
		> customer support > search by ISBN		


In david’s emails :
- include:
	- the vendor
	- when received (because he has to look for the invoice)

For “Paid but not received”
- check holds / items to make sure that JMRL does have them (that is, the items are here, but they were not marked in the system as having arrived)
- this goes to Fred



Order cleanup from CTM perspective :
- I get a calendar event monthly saying to do this
- Run a list based off of the saved search "order cleanup" incrementing the date by one month
- Email collection specialist
